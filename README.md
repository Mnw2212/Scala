A few projects in Scala

Numbers
---------

**find PI to the Nth digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

**Fibonacci Sequence**

**Prime Factoriation**

**Next Prime Number**

**Find Cost of Tile to cover W x H floor**

**Mortgage Calculator**

**Change Return Program**

Text
---------
**Reverse A string**

**Count Vowels**

**Check if Palindorme**



These are a few simple problems.
As I proceed learning scala, I will add solutions and increase the problems too...
