A few projects in Scala

Numbers
---------

**find PI to the Nth digit**
**Fibonacci Sequence**
**Prime Factoriation**
**Next Prime Number**
**Find Cost of Tile to cover W x H floor**
**Mortgage Calculator**
**Change Return Program**

Text
---------
**Reverse A string**
**Count Vowels**
**Check if Palindorme**



These are a few simple problems.
As I proceed learning scala, I will add solutions and increase the problems too...
